There is evidence that subclones within tumours can cooperate. In breast cancer, minor subpopulations can drive metastatic progression by modulating the tumour microenvironment.
A minor subclone secretes IL11 which influences neutrophils to create changes which allow metastasis. A minor subclone also secretes FIGF which increases angiogenesis and vascular permeability. These sub clones represent 1 - 5% of tumour cells [Janiszewska et al. 2019].

In Wnt-driven breast tumours, cooperation between Hras mutant and wild type clones was required for efficient tumour propagation that relied on luminary produced Wnt. The Hras mutant cells have basal identity whilst the wild type cells have luminal identity. Hras is an oncogene, and so once mutants arise it would normally be expected that they dominate the tumour, but the requirement for Wnt production meant that the fraction of Has mutants was <0.3 [Cleary et al. 2014].

In breast cancer, IL11 clones enhanced tumour growth non-cell autonomously. IL11 appeared to have an indirect effect enhancing cell proliferation via increased vascularisation and remodelling of the extracellular matrix [Marusyk et al. 2014].

Mathematical models lead to the rejection of the hypothesis of independent clonal growth rates, and the most likely hypothesis was that IL11 clones increased the growth rates of all clones.
